		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>My name is Anton and I am a fresh, out of the box, frontend developer!<br><br>
			For the previous two years I have been studying frontend development at Medieinstitutet. During the last 26 weeks of the education, I have been on an internship at Coolstuff, a very nice place with great people. I have been learning a lot about working as a frontend developer in an inhouse development team, developing and maintaining the e-commerce site and I am very grateful for such a good internship. In September this year I will graduate, and I’m hyped to get out there to continue my journey as a developer!<br><br>
			Who am I then, except from what was mentioned above. I am about a year away from turning 30 and for about 26 years of my life I was a complete stranger to writing code. That changed in the first act of the corona pandemic when I got the boot from the recruitment firm I was working on due to previously mentioned pandemic. I have been interested in development and code for quite some time, but I have only participated from the side line. What I mean is that during my work and educational life I have been, in different ways connected to development. As a recruiter/researcher I have been working with tech companies and candidates. And I have also done a few courses in graphic design which in most cases is deeply connected to development, especially frontend.<br><br>
			So instead of looking for another position within the recruitment branch I decided to give the development interest a chance. I did a few online tutorials, read up a bit on the educational paths available and ended up applying for the frontend development program at Medieinstitutet. Medieinstitutet ended up being a great choice and now after two years of education, including 7 months of real work experience I am ready for my next step.<br><br>
			Besides the coding part I am also interested in music. I´m trying to become descent at playing guitar and love to dig in vinyl crates or explore new music. Skateboard is another interest of mine and, when possible, the snow equivalent. I also enjoy drawing and illustrating, hanging out with friends, cooking food(sometimes) and playing games.<br><br>
			So eighter you are here, just snooping around which is completely fine, or you might have a work opportunity. In both cases, mainly the last, you could contact me. You´ll find my information in my
